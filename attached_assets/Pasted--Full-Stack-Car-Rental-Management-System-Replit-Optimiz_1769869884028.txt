🚗 Full-Stack Car Rental Management System (Replit-Optimized)
📌 Project Description

A full-stack web application that allows customers to browse, search, and book rental cars online, while administrators manage vehicles, reservations, and view business analytics.
The system is designed to run entirely on Replit, using its built-in PostgreSQL database and Replit Auth.

🧠 Core Business Logic
🚫 Prevent Double Booking

Before confirming a booking, check:

SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE car_id = $1
AND (
  (start_date <= $2 AND end_date >= $2)
  OR
  (start_date <= $3 AND end_date >= $3)
);


If any record exists → ❌ booking denied.

💰 Price Calculation
Total Price = Daily Rate × Number of Rental Days


Minimum rental: 1 day

Automatically computed on backend
